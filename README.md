## The Big Cats Classifier

I have always had a problem in recognizing big cats especially to differentiate cheetah's, leopard's, tigers. I was learning the FastAI v2 by reading the book and wondered why not build a classifier for this end-to-end, deploy this and see how the model performs.

1. Cheetah
1. Cougar
1. Jaguar
1. Leopard
1. Lion
1. Snow leopard
1. Tiger


The tiger and lion are comparitively easier to identify but lets see how the model performs and hopefully help me in recognizing these Big Cats better.
